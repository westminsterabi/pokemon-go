Pokemon Go[lang]

Thanks and apologies to the following articles and resources: 
* [putting eval in go](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2016/11/16/putting-eval-in-go/)
* [executing shell commands, scripts, and executables in go](https://medium.com/rungo/executing-shell-commands-script-files-and-executables-in-go-894814f1c0f7)

To run this monstrosity, execute `make pokemon` within the directory. 
Then you can run `./pokemon-go -filename <whatever>` to run any syntactically correct pokemon-go[lang] program.
